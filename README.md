# GeneticAlgorithm1
First implementation of a genetic algorithm.

This project will implement a genetic algorithm that will try to find a good solution to a 2D packing problem 

[given a domain and a set of points with some constraints, find a placing that comply with all the constraints and the added distance from one point to all the other is maximised]

Points could be seen as disks, and we do not want to have overlapping disks, moreover we want the disks to be as far from each other as possible.
